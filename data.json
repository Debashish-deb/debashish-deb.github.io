  "aboutOptions": "I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer specializing in building and designing exceptional digital experiences. My passion lies in creating robust user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems. I'm proficient in a wide range of technologies, including JavaScript (ES6+), GoLang, HTML5, CSS3, React, and Node.js. My projects, such as the 'Cars-Viewer' (a Golang-based application with a RESTful API) and the 'Match-Making App' (built with JavaScript and Golang), demonstrate my ability to handle both front-end and back-end development. I enjoy the challenge of crafting intuitive user interfaces and building efficient, scalable server-side logic. I'm currently deepening my expertise through the Kood/Sisu full-stack web development program, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and take on new challenges. My background in biotechnology (with a Master of Science degree from the University of Helsinki) has also instilled in me a strong analytical mindset and a meticulous approach to problem-solving, qualities that I bring to every project. My focus is on delivering high-quality, well-tested code that meets and exceeds expectations."
