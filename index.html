        <h2>About Me</h2>
      <hr color = "darkblue" noshade>
        <p>
            With a Master of Science degree in Biotechnology from the University of Helsinki, I am passionate about applying my knowledge and skills to various domains and industries. At ABB, I work as an Assembly Technician, where I assemble and package different models of inverter drives, ensuring quality and efficiency. I also use my skills in process improvement, data analysis, and problem-solving to optimize the assembly procedures and generate reports on the product performance and issues. Besides my current role, I have a strong background in biotechnology research, having worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Helsinki for over a year and six years of experience in logistics, working as an Assistant for Early Morning Delivery at Posti Group Oyj, where I coordinated and delivered packages to customers. Through these diverse experiences, I have developed skills in project management, teamwork, communication, and customer service. My goal is to leverage my skills and experience to contribute to the innovation and growth of the organizations I work with, as well as to learn new things and develop myself professionally.
